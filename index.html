              I come from a Filipino background and I have some basic conversational skills in Tagalog. I was orginially studying a Bachelors of Radiation Sciences at Monash, I stopped my studies in the course early this year to begin
              studying Information Technology at RMIT this year. Some hobbies I have are gaming, mechanical keyboards and shows/movies. 
            </p1>

              Interest in IT
            </h2>
            <p1>
              My interest for IT started early on. I've always liked gaming with my interest developing when I started looking into PC gaming. From there I became so interested in IT. The hardware aspect was what I was really interested in early on.
              I began getting more interested and from there I built my own PC, and recently I built my own mechanical keyboard. My interest from IT not only spured from gaming but also from LinusTechTips who I found early on. Aside from buidling a 
              PC my other experience in IT comes from some basic coding and soldering that I have done. 
              My reason for choosing RMIT was the online offering. With the flexibility of completeing the course on online I would be able to work as well as have my studies work around my social and work life. I expect to learn and futher develop my 
              skills in programming from these studies.

            Cybersecurity is ad specific field that has appealed to me in IT. The job description is one looking for a Security systems engineer, with the role of engineering, designing, commissioning and suport of a variety of 
            electronic systems. This includes intruder detection, access control high security and IP video systems. The idea of designing a system like this is interesting to me. Having built a speaker from scratch, while it 
            doesn't compare was an enjoyable experience working on all the parts and systems involved. Qualifications for the job would include, certifications and experience in cyber security and the design and implementation 
            of systems. While I do not have such qualifications, I am looking to get my Comptia A+ certificate soon and possibly other certifications.

            While not completely accurate, the tests show the type of person I am when it comes to learning as well as in general. The results show me as a thinker, while also being an open. It also shows that I am agreeable
            and am a visual learner. Working in a team will be easy as I will be able to think through everyone's ideas and provide my own input withouth completely disregarding someone elses opinions and thoughts.
